Approach for developing national information on soil erosion,,
Approach,Development of national database of soil erosion factors and measured and/or qualitative soil erosion data for modelling soil erosion,
,Erosion modelling for national scale assessment of soil erosion,
Input data preparation (Table 2.3),,
Input data,Climate,"Precipitation, Temperature, Wind, Relative Humidity"
,Soil,"Sand, Silt, Clay, Organic matter, Carbonate, Bulk density, Structure, drainage"
,Relief,DEM
,Cover,"Land cover, surface stoniness, MODIS (Mod09A) images"
,Management,"Soil conservation practices, Tillage intensity, crop residue management"
Expected outputs,,
Outputs,Output 1,National maps of soil erosion factors for modelling erosion
,,30 arc-second (~1x1 km) GeoTiff map format in WGS84 geographic projection
,Output 2,"National maps of soil erosion (dominant types, affected areas, hotspot areas)"
,,30 arc-second (~1x1 km) GeoTiff map format in WGS84 geographic projection
,Output 3,Technical report for national mapping of soil erosion
,,PDF document
