# Setting-up the software environment
*Y. Yigini*

This cookbook focuses on SOC modeling using open source digital mapping tools. The instructions in this chapter will guide the user through installing and manually configuring the software to be used for DSM procedures for Microsoft Windows desktop platform. Instructions for other platforms (e.g. Linux Flavours, MacOS) can be found through free online resources.

## Use of R, RStudio and R Packages

**R** is a language and environment for statistical computing. It provides a wide variety of statistical (e.g. linear modeling, statistical tests, time-series, classification, clustering, etc.) and graphical methods, and is highly extensible. 

### Obtaining and installing R

Installation files and instructions can be downloaded from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).

1. Go to the following link https://cran.r-project.org/ to download and install **R**. 
2. Pick an installation file for your platform. 

### Obtaining and installing RStudio

Beginners will find it very hard to start using **R** because it has no Graphical User Interface (GUI). There are some GUIs which offer some of the functionality of **R**. **RStudio** makes **R** easier to use. It includes a code editor, debugging and visualization tools. Similar steps need to be followed to install **RStudio**.

1. Go to https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ to download and install **RStudio**'s open source edition.
2. On the download page, *RStudio Desktop, Open Source License* option should be selected.
3. Pick an installation file for your platform. 

### Getting started with R	

* **R** manuals:                  http://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html
* Contributed documentation:      http://cran.r-project.org/other-docs.html

## R packages

When you download **R**, you get the basic **R** system which implements the **R** language. **R** becomes more useful with the large collection of packages that extend the basic functionality of it. **R** packages are developed by the **R** community.

  - tidyverse book (R for data science)
  - caret (cookbook)

### Finding R packages

The primary source for **R** packages is [CRANâ€™s](https://cran.r-project.org/) official website, where currently about 12,000 available packages are listed. For spatial applications, various packages are available. You can obtain information about the available packages directly on CRAN with the `available.packages()` function. The function returns a matrix of details corresponding to packages currently available at one or more repositories. An easier way to browse the list of packages is using the [*Task Views*](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/) link, which groups together packages related to a given topic.
